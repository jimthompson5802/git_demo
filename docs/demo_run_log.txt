--- Notes / next actions
- Worktree creation in this run used `git worktree add /tmp/git_demo_wt -b feature/experiment main` to create the branch in the new worktree and avoid the "already used by worktree" error.
- If you want a full untrimmed log, I can add it to this file or attach it separately.
